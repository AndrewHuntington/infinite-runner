# Rocket Mouse

My version of the infinite runner game from the Infinite Runner in Phaser 3 with TypeScript book by [Ourcade](https://ourcade.co/).

Bootstrapped with the [Phaser 3 TypeScript Parcel Template](https://github.com/ourcade/phaser3-typescript-parcel-template.git)

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndrewHuntington/infinite-runner.git
```

This will create a folder named `infinite-runner`. You can specify a different folder name like this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndrewHuntington/infinite-runner.git my-folder-name
```

Go into your new project folder and install dependencies:

```bash
cd infinite-runner # or 'my-folder-name'
npm install
```

Start development server:

```
npm run start
```

To create a production build:

```
npm run build
```

Production files will be placed in the `dist` folder. Then upload those files to a web server. ðŸŽ‰
